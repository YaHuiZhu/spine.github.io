Spine provides a number of ways of handling relationships between models, such as *has many* and *belongs to* relationships.

However, ideally you should try and abstract relationships out of your models on the client-side if they're not absolutely necessary. Checkout *A note on API design* in the [Ajax guide](ajax.html) for more information. Anyway, if relationships are necessary, here's how to use them.

##Usage

Spine's relationship logic is available in a separate module to the rest of the library, [relation.js](https://raw.github.com/spine/spine/master/lib/relation.js). You'll need to include that in your application before continuing.

##Has many associations

You can set up *has many* associations by using `hasMany(name, path)`. For example:

    //= CoffeeScript
    class Photo extends Spine.Model
      @configure 'Photo'

      @belongsTo 'album', 'Album'

    class Album extends Spine.Model
      @configure 'Album', 'name'

      @hasMany 'photos', 'models/photo'

    //= JavaScript
    var Photo = Spine.Model.sub();
    Photo.configure('Photo');
    Photo.belongsTo('album', 'Album');

    var Album = Spine.Model.sub();
    Album.configure('Album', 'name);

    Album.hasMany('photos', 'Photo');

The `hasMany()` function takes the name of the association, the path to the associated model, and an optional foreign key.

If you're using [CommonJS modules](commonjs.html), than use the path to the model as you'd `require()` it. In the example above, this is `models/photo`. Otherwise, pass a string indicating the global available variable referring to the associated model, in this case `Photo`.

Usage is fairly straightforward. The association gives you a few functions, such as `all()`, `find()` and `create()`:

    //= CoffeeScript  
    album = Album.create()

    # Fetch all album's photos
    album.photos().all()

    album.photos().create(
      name: "First photo"
    )

    album.photos().find( Photo.first().id )

##Belongs to associations

A *belongs to* association is very similar, using the `belongsTo(name, path)` function.

    //= CoffeeScript
    class Album extends Spine.Model
      @configure 'Album', 'name'

    class Photo extends Spine.Model
      @configure 'Photo'

      @belongsTo 'album', 'Album'

    //= JavaScript
    var Album = Spine.Model.sub();
    Album.configure('Album', 'name);

    var Photo = Spine.Model.sub();
    Photo.configure('Photo');
    Photo.belongsTo('album', 'Album');

Like `hasMany()`, the `belongsTo()` function gives you an relationship property on record instances, in this case called `album`.

    //= CoffeeScript
    album = Album.create({name: "First Album"})
    photo = Photo.create({album: album})

    assertEqual( photo.album(), album )
    assertEqual( photo.album_id, album.id )
