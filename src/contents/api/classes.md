Spine provides classes as part of its JavaScript compatibility layer, as internally, Spine uses CoffeeScript classes.

## Class methods

### `@sub([includeProperties, extendProperties])`

Used to create new classes, or inherit from existing ones. For example, creating a new class would look like this:

    var User = Spine.Class.sub();

Or inheriting from an existing class would look like this:

    var Teacher = User.sub();

You can pass in an optional set of include or extend properties that will be added to the class.

    var User = Spine.Class.sub({
      instanceFunction: function(){
        // Blah
      }
    });

### `new`

Classes are constructor functions, so they can be instantiated using the `new` keyword:

    var User = Spine.Class.sub();
    var user = new User;

### `@extend(Module)`

`@extend()` adds class methods.

    var User = Spine.Class.sub();
    User.extend({
      find: function(){
        /* ... */
      }
    });

    User.find();

### `@include(Module)`

`@include()` adds instance methods.

    var User = Spine.Class.sub();
    User.include({
      name: "Default Name"
    });

    assertEqual( (new User).name, "Default Name" );

### `@proxy(function)`

Wraps a function in a proxy, so it's always invoked in the class' context.

## Instance methods

### `proxy()`

Wraps a function in a proxy, so it's always invoked in the instance's context.
