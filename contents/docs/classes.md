Classes are a great way of encapsulating logic and name-spacing. They're used throughout Spine, especially when it comes to models and controllers. JavaScript's object literals are fine for static classes, but it's often useful to create classical classes with inheritance and instances.

Although JavaScript doesn't have native class support, it can be emulated fairly convincingly using constructor functions and prototypal inheritance. Classes are just another tool, and are as useful in JavaScript as they are in any other language. 

If you're using pure JavaScript to build your applications, rather than CoffeeScript, you should check out the penultimate section in this guide, *JavaScript Classes*. 

##Implementation

For classes, Spine uses CoffeeScript's [native class implementation](http://arcturo.github.com/library/coffeescript/03_classes.html), for example:

    class User
      # Class method
      @find: (id) ->
        (@records or= {})[id]
      
      # called on instantiation
      constructor: (attributes = {}) ->
        @attributes = attributes

      # Instance methods
      save: ->
      destroy: ->
      
To instantiate classes, use the `new` keyword (behind the scenes, classes are constructor functions).
      
    user = new User(name: "Dark Knight")
    user.save()
    user.destroy()
    
    user = User.find(1)
    
To inherit one class for another in CoffeeScript, use `extends`.

    class Users extends Spine.Controller
      constructor: ->
        super

If you're extending another class, and overriding the `constructor` function, make sure you call `super` - especially when it comes to Spine models and controllers.

##Context

JavaScript programs often involve a lot of context changes, especially when it comes to event callbacks. Rather than manually proxying callbacks, so they're executed in the correct scope, CoffeeScript's function syntax provides a useful alternative, fat arrow functions (`=>`). 

    class TaskApp extends Spine.Controller
      constructor: ->
        super
        Task.bind("create",  @addOne)
        Task.bind("refresh", @addAll)
        Task.fetch()

      addOne: (task) =>
        view = new Tasks(item: task)
        @append(view.render())

      addAll: =>
        Task.each(@addOne)
        
In the example above, `addOne()` and `addAll()` are both using the fat arrow function definitions (`=>`), rather than the normal thin arrows (`->`). This preserves the function's execution context, so although the `Task` event callbacks are executing them in the context of `Task`, they're proxied and run in the the correct context, `TaskApp`.

##Modules

Spine extends CoffeeScript's classes with support for modules, using `Spine.Module`. This gives you `@extend()` and `@include()` support, for easily adding class and instance properties respectively. To use modules, just inherit a class from `Spine.Module`.
    
    class MyTest extends Spine.Module
      @extend ClassModule
      @include InstanceModule
      
Spine's internal classes inherit from `Spine.Module`, so they all have `@extend()` and `@include()` support:

    class User extends Spine.Model
      @configure "User"
      @extend Spine.Model.Ajax
  
Modules are simply a set of properties, like so:
    
    OrmModule = {
      find: (id) -> /* ... */
    }
    
Modules can also contain callback functions, `extended()` and `included()`:

    OrmModule =
      find: (id) -> /* ... */
      extended: -> 
        console.log("module extended: ", @)

##JavaScript classes

If you're writing your CoffeeScript languages in plain JavaScript, you obviously don't have access to CoffeeScript's class syntax. Spine solves this problem for you, by exposing `Spine.Class`:

    var Users = Spine.Class.sub();
    
Calling `sub()` on a class will subclass it. You can either pass `sub()` a set of instance and class properties, or call `extend()` and `include()` directly on the class. 
    
    Users.extend({
      find: function(id){
        /* ... */         
      }
    });
    
    Users.include({
      destroy: function(){
        /* ... */ 
      }
    });
    
To inherit from the `Users` class in the example above, simple call `sub()` on it:

    var Owner = Users.sub();
    
Rather than `constructor`, class initialization functions are called `init()`

    var User = Spine.Class.sub({
      init: function(){
        // Called on instantiation
        console.log(arguments);
      }
    });
    
    var user = new User({name: "Spock"});

Calling parent (super) functions is slightly more convoluted than in CoffeeScript.

    var User = Spine.Controller.sub({
      init: function(){
        this.constructor.__super__.init.apply(this, arguments)
      }
    });
    
As you can see in the example above, using Spine controllers and models from JavaScript is simply a matter of calling `sub()` on them.
